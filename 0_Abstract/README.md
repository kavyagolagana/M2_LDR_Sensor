# ABSTRACT:

* Light-dependent resistances (LDR) are cheap light sensors. A less known lightdetector is the electret microphone, whose electret membrane functions as a perfectabsorber, but only detects pulsed light. The aim of this study was to analyze the use of aLDR and an electret microphone as a light sensor in an optical spectroscopy system usingpulsed light. A photoacoustic spectroscopy setup was used, substituting the photoacousticchamber by the light sensor proposed. The absorption spectra of two different liquids wereanalyzed. The results obtained allow the recommendation of the LDR as the first choice inthe construction of cheap homemade pulsed light spectroscopy systems.

* The light dependent resistor (LDR) is a sensor whose resistance decreases when light impinges onit. This kind of sensor is commonly used in light sensor circuits in open areas, to control street lampsfor example. Another possible use is in spectroscopic apparatus [1]. In this kind of apparatus,continuous light or pulsed light can be used. Continuous light is used in common spectroscopicapparatus. The use of lock-in amplifiers made the use of pulsed light in spectroscopy easier, as iscommonly used in photoacoustic spectroscopy
