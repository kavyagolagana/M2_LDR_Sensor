# TITLE: LDR_SENSOR
## INTRODUCTION

* A photoresistor or light dependent resistor is an electronic component that is sensitive to light. When light falls upon it, then the resistance changes. Values of the resistance of the LDR may change over many orders of magnitude the value of the resistance falling as the level of light increases.

It is not uncommon for the values of resistance of an LDR or photoresistor to be several megohms in darkness and then to fall to a few hundred ohms in bright light.
* LDRs are made from semiconductor materials to enable them to have their light sensitive properties. Many materials can be used, but one popular material for these photoresistors is cadmium sulphide, CdS, although the use of these cells is now restricted in Europe because of environmental issues with the use of cadmium.

Similarly other cadmium based semiconductor materials like cadmium CdSe are also restricted. Other materials that can be used include lead sulphide, PbS and indium antimonide, InSb.

## RESEARCH
### OBJECTIVE

* LDR stands for Light Dependent Resistor. They allow you to detect light. Depending on the amount of light falling on LDR, its resistance changes. As shown as in below figure whenever light falls on LDR, its resistance decreases, allowing current (mentioned in red line) to pass through it.
### FEATURES

* Characteristic of the LDR sensor
LDR sensor are very sensitive to light. The stronger the light, the lower the resistance. With the increase of illumination intensity, the resistance value of the ldr photoresistor decreases rapidly, and it can be reduced to less than 1K.

 ### WHAT:
   
* An LDR is a component that has a (variable) resistance that changes with the light intensity that falls upon it. This allows them to be used in light sensing circuits. 

### WHERE:

* These devices are used where there is a need to sense the presence and absence of light is necessary. These resistors are used as light sensors and the applications of LDR mainly include alarm clocks, street lights, light intensity meters, burglar alarm circuits.

### WHY:

* Photoresistors, also known as light dependent resistors (LDR), are light sensitive devices most often used to indicate the presence or absence of light, or to measure the light intensity.

### When:

* Light dependent resistors have a low cost and simple structure. These resistors are frequently used as light sensors. These resistors are mainly used when there is a need to sense the absence and presence of the light such as burglar alarm circuits, alarm clock, light intensity meters, etc.

### HOW:

* The LDR resistance drops with light, which causes the current in both resistors to increase (I=V/R), and therefore the voltage across the other (non-LDR) increases. So as the LDR resistance varies with Light, the Voltage at A0 will too. The LDR has a high value when no light is present.

## ADVANTAGES:

* The linearity of photoelectric conversion under strong illumination is poor.
* The frequency response (the ability of the device to detect the fast changing optical signals) is very low.
The internal photoelectric effect has nothing to do with the electrodes (only photodiodes do), that is, DC power supply can be used.
* Sensitivity depends on the semiconductor material and the wavelength of the incident light.
* It is coated with epoxy packaging, and has good reliability, small volume, high sensitivity, quick response and good spectrum characteristic. 

## DISADVANTAGES:

*  The linearity of photoelectric conversion under strong illumination is poor.
* The frequency response (the ability of the ldr light dependent resistor to detect the fast changing optical signals) is very low.
* It is affected heavily by the temperature and has a low response speed. The delay time between MS and S is affected by the illumination of the incident light (photodiode has no shortcomings, and photodiode sensitivity is higher than LDR sensor), which is a consumable material.
